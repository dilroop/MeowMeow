# Meow Meow

Meow Meow is the awesome cat gif app, proving to be the single best cat gif platform when
rest of internet sites are down.

When app initially runs it load random 20 gifs of cats with no hat. Home screen is using
Material Backdrop experimental component. Where back layer has filter for cat gif search.
If there is no internet or zero results, message is displayed.

Some UI Improvements that can be made:-
- Grid Item has gaps if adjacent grid item is longer.
- More filters could be added
- Dark mode could be further improved.
- Click on gif/image to make it full screen and share options.

What more
- Paging could be implemented to page through each search.
- Images could be cached locally.
- Project is missing instrumented tests.
